The two CoW specific haks are here.  However, you will also need the following third party haks.

Alternately, if you are using Steam, you can subscribe to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1440368464

Once you are done with downloading, you should have:
- cow.tlk in your tlk folder
- two Anemoi haks, two Realms of Myth haks, and crprural.hak in your hak folder. 

If using Steam, they will all be buried in your Steam workshop downloads.  If doing manual downloads, you'll need to put them in 
the hak and tlk folders under My Documents\Neverwinter Nights.
