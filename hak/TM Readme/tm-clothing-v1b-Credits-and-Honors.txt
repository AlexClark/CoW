If in the process of putting all the various haks together we failed to note yours in the list below, please accept our apologies.  Let us know of this lack so we can add your well deserved credit to the honors list.

MUCH personal thanks to Lisa for her documentation on how to manipulate and work with armor.  Not to mention the loads of clothing that are so well created and documented.  Thanks also to Eligio_Sacateca for making the Armory.  Haks added in version .97 or later have their hak number noted next to them.

More thanks to Lisa for upgrading our female human heads after the 1.66 Bioware patch.

As of versions 1b, heads have been removed from this hak and into their own hak.
